/**
 * MVCC overview
 *
 * A good description of MVCC which we used as basis for our implementation is given here:
 * http://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/schwalb-imdm2014.pdf
 *
 * Conceptually, the idea is that each row has additional "columns" which are used to mark rows as locked for a
 * transaction and to describe when the row was created and deleted to ensure correct visibility. These vectors are
 * written to by AbstractReadWriteOperators, i.e., Insert, Update and Delete.
 *
 * Rows invisible for the current transaction are filtered by the Validate operator.
 *
 * ReadWriteOperators can fail if they detect conflicting writes by other operators. In that case, the transaction must
 * be rolled back. All executed read/write operators’ rollback_records() method needs to called and the transaction be
 * marked as rolled back.
 *
 * The TransactionManager is a thread-safe singleton that hands out TransactionContexts with monotonically increasing
 * IDs and ensures all transactions are committed in the correct order. It also holds a global last commit ID, which is
 * the commit ID of the last transaction that has been committed. When a new transaction context is created, it retains
 * a copy of the current last commit ID, stored as snapshot_commit_id, which represents a snapshot of the database. The
 * snapshot commit ID together with the MVCC data is used to filter out any changes made after the creation
 * transaction context.
 *
 * TransactionContext contains data used by a transaction, mainly its ID, the snapshot commit ID explained above, and,
 * when it enters the commit phase, the TransactionManager gives it a CommitContext, which contains
 * a new commit ID that is used to make its changes visible to others.
